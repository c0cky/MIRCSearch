This is the repository of MIRCSearch

The graphical search engine created by Camron Godbout for the Moving Images Research Collection (MIRC) at University of South Carolina.
Created by using Latent Semantic Indexing of movie meta data.

This is missing the python files to scrape the data from the website and create the simdatabase server. These are available on request.
